# Claude Code Skills

This folder contains the specialized skill definitions for Tommy's coding style. To maintain a single source of truth, these skills are "dehydrated" and point to the core documentation in the repository root.

## How to Use

To import these skills into your own project (e.g., while working in a sibling directory like `do-do`), use the following prompt in your project's Claude Code session:

> "Follow the hydration protocol in ../tommy-style/.claude/COPY_SKILLS.md to copy the skills into my current project"
